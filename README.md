# FewShotLearning-NLP
Few Shot learning is very good concept in which even we have very few sample of a class we can get good accuracy . In this we match a class sample with other samples whether a sample match with other sample or not . if samples match we assign then True/0 else 1 . Best feature train once test anywhere . Because if samples match then only true else give any data to models returns MisMatch .
